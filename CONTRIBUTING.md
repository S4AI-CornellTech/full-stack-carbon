# Contributing & Handoff Guide

One-page orientation for collaborators **reviewing** this suite and **continuing** to work on it.
Read this first — it links to the deeper docs instead of duplicating them.

## What this is

`full-stack-carbon` bundles six lab tools for carbon modeling of computer hardware and systems —
device manufacturing → server provisioning → software carbon attribution — as git submodules, with
a single guided **walkthrough** ("the life of a data center") built for an academic workshop. The
tools: **ACT, COFFEE, CarbonClarity, MicroGreen, EServe (a.k.a. EcoServe), Fair-CO2**.

Two things were built on top of bundling them:
1. A reframed **walkthrough** that runs each tool from committed data (artifact-evaluation style) and
   ties them into one story.
2. An **`act_core` unification** that de-duplicates the three ACT-derived codebases (ACT, MicroGreen's
   `EmbodiedCarbonModeling`, EServe) onto one shared package.

## Status at a glance

| Workstream | What | State |
|---|---|---|
| A — plumbing & envs | six submodules, per-tool venvs, `Makefile`, CI | ✅ done |
| B — the walkthrough | six reframed segments, golden fallbacks, chain verify | ✅ done (tag `v0.1.0`) |
| C — `act_core` unification | ACT + MicroGreen + EServe share one core | ✅ done (shipped on `main`) |

A from-scratch clone → `make setup` → `make all-demos` is **verified to run end-to-end**.
The suite's `main` ships the unified suite; the pre-existing **tool** repos keep their `act_core` work
on `act-core` branches (their own `main`s untouched).

## ⚠️ Branch model — read before pushing

| Branch | What's on it |
|---|---|
| **`main`** (default) | the **released unified suite** (`act_core`; EServe H100 ≈ 103 kg) — what a plain clone gets |
| `act-core` | **active development**; currently even with `main`, moves ahead as work continues — promote `main` → `act-core` to cut the next milestone |
| `suite-assembly` + tag **`v0.1.0`** | the **pre-unification** stable snapshot (each tool on its original code; EServe H100 ≈ 154 kg) |

**Constraint (from the repo owner):** the `act_core` changes in the pre-existing public **tool** repos
— **ACTv2, MicroGreen, EmbodiedCarbonModeling** (and EServe) — live on their **`act-core` branches**;
those repos' own `main`s are untouched. **Do not merge them to the tool repos' `main` or open PRs**
until the team has reviewed. (The *suite's* `main` pins those `act-core` commits — that's how the
unified suite ships — which does **not** merge anything into the tool repos themselves. EServe and the
suite are new repos. COFFEE's one-line `NVMExplorer` fix was an owner-approved hygiene change already on
its `main`; CarbonClarity and Fair-CO2 are untouched.)

Pinned commits (for review / verification):

| repo | active branch | tip | original default |
|---|---|---|---|
| full-stack-carbon (suite) | `main` (= `act-core`) | _tip; see `git log`_ | was `6de3e0c` (empty init) |
| ACTv2 | `act-core` | `8764d6a` | main `abc9fbb` |
| EServe | `act-core` | `d38bf93` | main `a1b33a5` |
| MicroGreen | `act-core` | `7f03583` | main `384d8b7` |
| EmbodiedCarbonModeling | `act-core` | `d9fd240` | `microgreen` `365589b` |
| COFFEE | `main` | `257f4d5` | was `8e019a6` |
| CarbonClarity | _(untouched)_ | — | main `ae209c9` |
| Fair-CO2 | _(untouched)_ | — | main `a1142d6` |

> **COFFEE** carries a one-line repo-hygiene fix (unrelated to `act_core`), now on `main`: it adds the
> missing `.gitmodules` mapping for COFFEE's `NVMExplorer` submodule (the gitlink existed but had no
> URL, so `git submodule update --init --recursive` failed). The suite pins COFFEE at this commit
> (= COFFEE `main` HEAD), so a suite clone gets the working mapping.

- Unified suite (default `main`): `git submodule update --init` right after cloning
- Pre-unification snapshot: `git checkout suite-assembly && git submodule update --init`

## Get it running

**No global install needed.** `make setup` uses a system [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if present;
otherwise it provisions a **repo-local** `uv` under `.uv/` (gitignored) — binary, the per-tool Pythons
(3.11 / 3.12), and cache all stay inside the repo, so nothing is installed machine-wide. First run
needs a `python3` + network; `make clean` removes `.uv/` and `.envs/`. **Platforms:** Linux and macOS
(CI runs on Linux); on Windows use WSL.

```bash
make submodules     # init the six tools + MicroGreen's EmbodiedCarbonModeling
make setup          # build the six isolated per-tool venvs (uv-first); ~a few min
make all-demos      # run all six walkthrough segments, then verify the chain
make golden         # OR: show the committed backup figures with zero compute
make help           # every target
```

The tools carry incompatible pins (numpy 2.3.4/2.3.5/2.4.3; Python 3.11 vs 3.12), so each gets its
**own venv** under `.envs/<tool>/` (gitignored). EServe and MicroGreen also get `act_core` installed
editable. See `README.md` for the quickstart and `scripts/bootstrap.sh` for the env matrix.

---

## How the walkthrough works (Workstream B)

The story, order, and headline numbers live in **`walkthrough/README.md`**. The model:

- Each `walkthrough/NN_<tool>/` **recomputes from committed data** (no live workloads), writes a
  figure + `result.json`, and falls back to a committed `golden/` via `run.sh --golden`.
- Segments run **standalone** — the value one hands the next is committed into the next's `inputs/`.
- `make verify` (`walkthrough/lib/verify_chain.py`) asserts those handoffs line up.
- Each tool's **`TALKING_POINTS.md`** is its 5-min slide content (owners build the actual decks from it;
  honesty caveats are baked in). For **ACT / EServe / Fair-CO2** it now lives with the hands-on tutorial
  in the tool repo's `tutorial/`; for CarbonClarity / COFFEE / MicroGreen it's still in the suite segment.

**Hands-on tutorials live in the tool repos.** Each of ACT / EServe / Fair-CO2 has a self-contained
`tutorial/` folder (`TUTORIAL.md` + `TALKING_POINTS.md` + a `tutorial.*` runner + `exercises/` +
`solutions/`) that does NOT depend on the suite's `lib/`. The suite runs them via
`make tutorial-<tool>` (passing the per-tool env as `$PYTHON`); standalone:
`cd <Tool>/tutorial && PYTHON=…/bin/python ./tutorial.sh …`. (The collaborator's CarbonClarity / COFFEE /
MicroGreen tutorials follow the same in-repo pattern.)

**To edit/add a suite segment (the cross-tool AE-demo):** copy the shape of `walkthrough/05_eserve/`
(`run.sh` + `recompute.py` + `inputs/` + `golden/`), use the `walkthrough/lib/walk.py` helpers, and after
a real run snapshot the backup: `rm -f golden/* && cp figures/* golden/`.

## The `act_core` unification (Workstream C) — and how not to break it

Full log, every commit, and the regression procedure: **`act-core-migration/README.md`**.

In short: `act/core` + `act/models` were carved out of ACT into a pip-installable **`act_core`**
package (hosted in the ACTv2 repo). MicroGreen's `EmbodiedCarbonModeling` fork was **deleted** and
re-pointed at `act_core`; EServe's memory model was **converged** onto `act_core.MemoryModel`. ACT
stays byte-identical, ECM's 14 BOMs reproduce, and EServe's memory was corrected to the paper-backed
**HBM3e = 0.24** (the old 0.85 was unsourced — see `baselines/eserve/c3_convergence_deltas.md`).

- **ACT** consumes `act_core` via `PYTHONPATH`; **EServe** and **MicroGreen/ECM** consume it as the
  pip-installed package (`scripts/bootstrap.sh` installs it editable into their venvs).

**If you change `act_core`, run the regression checks** against the committed safety net in
`act-core-migration/baselines/`:
- **ACT:** `cd ACT && bash ci_script.sh`; and diff a BOM report vs `baselines/act/<bom>/`.
- **EServe:** `cd EServe && ../.envs/eserve/bin/python -m pytest tests` (incl. `test_h100_validation`).
- **MicroGreen/ECM:** re-run its 14 BOMs and diff `total_carbon` vs `baselines/microgreen/<bom>/`.
- **Walkthrough:** `make all-demos` must stay green.

---

## What's left / how to continue

- **Tool-repo review → merge (owner's call):** the tool repos' `act-core` branches (ACTv2, MicroGreen,
  ECM, EServe) are the review vehicle — green and reproducible. When the team signs off, merge each into
  its own `main` (or open PRs). The suite's `main` already ships these commits via gitlinks.
- **Keep developing on the suite's `act-core`**, then promote `main` → `act-core` to cut each milestone.
- **Repos are public** — all eight clone anonymously (the suite uses HTTPS submodule URLs).
- **Slide decks:** build from the six tools' `TALKING_POINTS.md` (ACT / EServe / Fair-CO2 in their
  `tutorial/` folders; CarbonClarity / COFFEE / MicroGreen in the suite segments).
- **Deferred technical follow-ups** (detailed in `act-core-migration/README.md`):
  - EServe's **SoC / PDN** are still EServe-specific (memory + SSD now converged onto `act_core`).
  - The HBM coefficient (0.24) is paper-backed; pulling the real figure from NVIDIA's H100 PCF PDF
    would settle the HBM-stacking-overhead question.
  - COFFEE's **lifetime/endurance** branch (only the embodied/density path is demoed).

## Doc map

| For… | Read |
|---|---|
| quickstart + suite overview | `README.md` |
| the walkthrough story + how to run it | `walkthrough/README.md` |
| a tool's hands-on tutorial + slide content | `<Tool>/tutorial/` (ACT/EServe/Fair-CO2); `walkthrough/<segment>/TALKING_POINTS.md` (CC/COFFEE/MicroGreen) |
| the `act_core` refactor: status, commits, regression | `act-core-migration/README.md` |
| the EServe memory-convergence deltas | `act-core-migration/baselines/eserve/c3_convergence_deltas.md` |
| every Make target | `make help` |
| a tool's own documentation | that submodule's own `README` |
| the source papers | `papers/` (kept local; gitignored) |

The reasoning behind specific choices (why HBM3e = 0.24, why the segment order, the "naive number →
real point" reframe) lives in the relevant `TALKING_POINTS.md` and `act-core-migration/README.md`.
